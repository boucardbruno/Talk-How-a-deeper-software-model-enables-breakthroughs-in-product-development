### How a deeper software model enables breakthroughs in product development            

Most products start with an initial software model, a model that is usually naive and superficial, based on shallow knowledge. This makes sense because you just started discovering and exploring that new product. So, we typically start by identifying nouns and verbs and using these as the initial objects and methods to build in our code. While the initial model helps you start getting fast feedback for your product, once you get more feedback, most of the time, it isn’t a helpful model anymore. They usually don’t provide a rational expression of the primary concerns of the domain experts anymore as time progresses to build that product. Not having that expression can hold you back from making essential breakthroughs for your product, breakthroughs that can be the differentiation factor in the market. Even worse, implementing the model in code might not even support these new breakthroughs.

Join us in this talk, where we present to you why we think the core model of your product must be continuously refactored towards a deeper model. We begin with a short introduction and explain the origin of domain-driven design and model-driven design. Then, we will explain the concepts of deep modeling and why tactical patterns with a Supple design are essential to doing deep modeling. We will dive into a concrete example, which we worked out with the model exploration whirlpool and collaborative modeling practices like EventStorming, Example Mapping,  and Responsibility mapping based on CRC cards. Finally, we dive into the code and show how we can get breakthroughs by continuously refactoring to deeper insights with a supple design getting a deep model.

### Kenny Baas-Schwegler
Kenny Baas-Schwegler is a software engineer and consultant focusing on software quality in Xebia. He mentors and coaches teams using practices and techniques from Domain Driven Design, Behaviour Driven Development, Test Driven Development, and Continuous Delivery.

He is an advocate for multidisciplinary collaboration in open spaces. Using techniques such as Event Storming and Example Mapping, he helps engineer requirements to design and model software. With these methods, he aims to create a transparent, collaborative domain space with constant and instant feedback when delivering software.

Besides daily work, he helps organize meetups for Behaviour Driven Development NL and Domain Driven Design Nederland.

### Bruno Boucard
Bruno Boucard has extensive experience in IT, which has allowed him to design better collaborative approaches to create high-impact products.

Like the hummingbird, everyone does their part to create software that will better impact its users. By leveraging a domain-driven design approach, Bruno facilitates more transparent communication between stakeholders and software creators through collaborative modeling and deep democracy, decoding complexities, resolving conflicts, and ensuring that software remains agile in the face of business demands.

As a consultant for OCTO Technology, a technical manager and software architect, and an agile and technical coach, Bruno catalyzes organizations and teams to design and construct sustainable and clean software architectures. He hosts the BDD Paris Meetup and is in the domain-driven design community.
